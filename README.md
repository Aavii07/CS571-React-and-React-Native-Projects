This repository highlights the projects I found most enjoyable and invested the most effort into during my university class on React and React Native development with Node.js.

Three of these projects are variations on a global messaging board, implemented differently to cater to web, mobile, and voice interfaces.
The other three projects include a university news mobile app, a website built for shopping and adopting cats, and a website to search for and filter students.

Below are demonstration videos pertaining to each project:
